# PR Companion - Automated Code Review System

**Drop-in AI-powered PR analysis for any GitHub repository**

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Files (30 seconds)
```bash
# Copy these 2 folders to your repository root:
.code-analysis/
.github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (1 minute)
1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Under **Branch**, select `gh-pages` and `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

> **Why needed?** Visual analysis images are hosted on GitHub Pages for embedding in PR comments.

### Step 3: GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)
1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret** and add:

| Name | Value | Required |
|------|--------|----------|
| `AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` | Your Azure AI endpoint URL | ✅ Yes |
| `AI_FOUNDRY_TOKEN` | Your Azure AI API key | ✅ Yes |
| `AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` (or your model) | ✅ Yes |

### Step 4: Test (30 seconds)
1. Create any PR in your repository
2. Watch for automated comments with visual analysis
3. Done! 🎉

### 🆘 Troubleshooting

**No comments appearing?**
- Check Actions tab for workflow runs
- Verify secrets are set correctly
- Ensure PR has code changes (not just markdown)

**Visual analysis images not showing?**
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → gh-pages)
- Check if gh-pages branch exists and has content
- Check if Pages deployment succeeded in Actions tab
- Images appear after ~15-30 seconds delay

**AI analysis failing?**
- Verify your Azure AI endpoint is active
- Check API key permissions
- Model name must match your deployment

**Need help?**
- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- All features work without AI (visuals only)
- Create an issue if problems persist

## 🧠 System Hypothesis

**"Visual AI analysis reduces PR review time by 50% while improving code quality by 40%"**

The system combines:
- **Visual processing** (humans understand images 60,000x faster than text)
- **AI pattern recognition** (catches issues humans miss)  
- **Automated workflows** (reduces manual overhead)
- **Consistent standards** (eliminates subjective reviews)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **PR Created** → Workflows trigger automatically
2. **Analysis** → AI examines code changes, generates insights
3. **Visuals** → Creates impact heatmaps, dependency graphs  
4. **Comments** → Posts results directly in PR with embedded images
5. **Labels** → Auto-applies relevant tags for quick filtering

**Zero maintenance required** - just create PRs and get analysis.
