# PR Companion - Automated Code Review System

**Drop-in AI-powered PR analysis for any GitHub repository**

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Copy Files
```bash
# Copy these folders to your repository root:
.code-analysis/
.github/workflows/
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets
Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
```
AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT = your-azure-ai-endpoint
AI_FOUNDRY_TOKEN = your-azure-ai-key  
AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL = gpt-4o (optional, defaults to gpt-4o)
```

### 3. Test
Create a PR → Watch automated comments appear with visual analysis

## 🧠 System Hypothesis

**"Visual AI analysis reduces PR review time by 50% while improving code quality by 40%"**

The system combines:
- **Visual processing** (humans understand images 60,000x faster than text)
- **AI pattern recognition** (catches issues humans miss)  
- **Automated workflows** (reduces manual overhead)
- **Consistent standards** (eliminates subjective reviews)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **PR Created** → Workflows trigger automatically
2. **Analysis** → AI examines code changes, generates insights
3. **Visuals** → Creates impact heatmaps, dependency graphs  
4. **Comments** → Posts results directly in PR with embedded images
5. **Labels** → Auto-applies relevant tags for quick filtering

**Zero maintenance required** - just create PRs and get analysis.
