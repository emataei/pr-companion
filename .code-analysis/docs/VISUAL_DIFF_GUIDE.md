# Simple UI Change Detection with Screenshots

## Overview
Automated detection and reporting of UI changes in pull requests. The system identifies UI file modifications, generates visual previews, and provides a structured summary for reviewers.

## Quick Setup

### 1. No Prerequisites Required
The system works out of the box with no additional setup needed. It automatically detects UI changes in:
- React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`)
- Vue components (`.vue`)
- Svelte components (`.svelte`)
- Stylesheets (`.css`, `.scss`, `.less`, `.sass`)

### 2. Screenshot Generation
The system automatically:
- Builds your project when UI changes are detected
- Captures screenshots of relevant pages
- Embeds them directly in PR comments
- Provides artifact downloads as backup

## What You'll Get

- Test the changes locally
- Verify responsive design if styles changed
- Check accessibility if components changed
```

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Detection
- Monitors all file changes in pull requests
- Identifies UI-related files by extension
- Categorizes changes (components, styles, pages)

### 2. Screenshot Generation
- Builds the project using `npm run build`
- Starts a development server
- Captures screenshots of changed pages using Playwright
- Embeds images directly in PR comments using base64 encoding

### 3. Image Embedding
- Screenshots are embedded directly in PR comments
- No external hosting required
- Images are visible immediately without downloads
- Backup artifacts are still available for download

### 4. Structured Reporting
- Organizes changes by type for easier review
- Embeds visual previews directly in comments
- Provides backup download links
- Includes actionable review checklist
