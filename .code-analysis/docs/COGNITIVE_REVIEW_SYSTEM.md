# AI-Era Code Review: Cognitive Complexity & Tiered Review System

## ðŸ§  Core Hypothesis

> **In the AI era, code generation is no longer the bottleneck â€” human comprehension is.**

> In the AI era, code generation is no longer the bottleneck â€” human comprehension is.
To sustain velocity and quality at scale, we must minimize unnecessary human review effort by aligning review depth with code risk, clarity, and impact.
A tiered review model, combined with AI-assisted code analysis and structured tagging, enables us to triage changes efficiently, focus human review only where it matters most, and reduce the code-to-approval cycle time without compromising software integrity.

The goal is to move from a manual, text-heavy process to a more automated, context-rich, and visually intuitive one.

## ðŸ“Š Cognitive Complexity Scoring System

Our system evaluates Pull Requests using a multi-dimensional scoring approach that measures the mental effort required to safely review and approve code changes.

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. Static Analysis Score (0-40 points)
- **Control structures** (if/for/while): +1 point each
- **Nesting depth**: +1 point per level beyond first
- **Function length**: +3 points (>50 lines), +1 point (>20 lines)
- **File size**: +5 points (>100 lines), +2 points (>50 lines)

#### 2. Impact Surface Score (0-30 points)
- **Migration files**: +10 points
- **Schema/Payment systems**: +10/9 points
- **API/Security changes**: +8 points
- **Config files**: +6 points
- **Dependencies**: +1 point per 5 imports (max +5)
- **External integrations**: +3 points for database/API keywords

#### 3. AI Complexity Score (0-30 points)
- **AI-powered assessment** of cognitive load and comprehension difficulty
- **Business logic complexity**: Pattern recognition and flow analysis
- **Cross-module dependencies**: Impact assessment
- **Fallback scoring**: Uses heuristics when AI unavailable

#### 4. Quality Penalties (+0-20 points)
- **Blocking issues**: Security vulnerabilities, type errors
- **Code quality issues**: Complexity violations, maintainability concerns
- **Best practice violations**: Missing tests, poor documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Unified Confidence Framework

Our system provides consistent confidence scoring across all AI analysis components to eliminate confusion and build reviewer trust.

### Confidence Levels & Actions

| Level | Range | Description | Review Action |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **HIGH** | 80-100% | AI analysis is reliable, can guide review focus | Focus on AI-highlighted areas |
| **MEDIUM** | 60-79% | AI provides useful insights, verify conclusions | Use AI as starting point, cross-reference |
| **LOW** | 40-59% | AI offers basic classification, manual review required | AI context only, thorough manual review |
| **VERY LOW** | <40% | Fallback analysis only, full manual review essential | Rely primarily on manual review |

### Confidence Components

The overall confidence is calculated from weighted components:

1. **Change Classification** (30% weight): Confidence in determining PR intent (feature/bugfix/refactor)
2. **Risk Assessment** (40% weight): Confidence in identifying potential risks and impacts  
3. **Impact Analysis** (30% weight): Confidence in predicting downstream effects

### Visual Indicators

- ðŸŸ¢ **HIGH**: Reliable AI analysis
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Useful insights, verify conclusions  
- ðŸŸ  **LOW**: Basic classification only
- ðŸ”´ **VERY LOW**: Manual review essential

## Tiered Review Framework

### Tier 0: Auto-Merge (0-30 points)
- **Review**: Automated CI/CD only
- **Criteria**: Low complexity, minimal risk
- **SLA**: Immediate merge on green CI
- **Examples**:
  - Formatting/linting fixes
  - Comment updates
  - Auto-generated code (types, docs)
  - Test snapshot updates

### Tier 1: Standard Review (31-69 points)
- **Review**: 1 team member approval required
- **Criteria**: Moderate complexity, normal changes
- **SLA**: 12 hours during business days
- **Examples**:
  - Feature implementations
  - Bug fixes
  - Minor refactoring
  - Configuration updates

### Tier 2: Expert Review (70-100 points)
- **Review**: 2+ domain experts required
- **Criteria**: High complexity, critical changes
- **SLA**: 48 hours, may require additional time
- **Examples**:
  - Core business logic
  - Security/authentication changes
  - Database migrations
  - API breaking changes

---

## Automatic Team Assignment

### Smart Escalation Logic
PRs are automatically escalated to higher tiers based on:
- **Security keywords**: `password`, `token`, `secret`, `auth`
- **Critical paths**: `src/core/`, `src/security/`, `database/`
- **High complexity scores**: Above 70 points
- **Database changes**: Migrations, schema modifications
- **Large changesets**: More than 10 files changed

### Team Configuration
```json
{
  "tier_1": {
    "teams": ["reviewers", "developers"],
    "max_reviewers": 1
  },
  "tier_2": {
    "teams": ["senior-developers", "architects"],
    "max_reviewers": 2
  }
}
```
